Welcome to Edamame's documentation!
===================================

Edamame is born under the inspiration of the pandas-profiling_:https://github.com/ydataai/pandas-profiling and pycaret_:https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret packages. The scope of edamame is to build friendly and helpful functions for handling the exploratory data analysis (EDA) step in a dataset studied and then train and analyse a model's battery for regression or classification problems.

To install the package,

``pip install edamame``

the edamame package works correctly inside a jupyter-notebook.
