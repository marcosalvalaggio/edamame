Welcome to Edamame's documentation!
===================================

Edamame is born under the inspiration of the `pandas-profiling <https://github.com/ydataai/pandas-profiling>`_ , `pycaret <https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret>`_, and `yellowbrick <https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/yellowbrick>`_ packages. The scope of edamame is to build friendly and helpful functions for handling the exploratory data analysis (EDA) step in a dataset studied and then train and analyse a model's battery for regression or classification problems.

To install the package,

``pip install edamame``

the edamame package works correctly inside a jupyter-notebook.

Edamame functionalities
=======================

The package consists of three modules: eda, which performs exploratory data analysis; and regressor and classifier, which handle the training of machine learning models for regression and classification, respectively.
